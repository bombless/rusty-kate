# rusty-kate
rusty-kate is a project to maintain a syntax highlighting configuration of Rust programming language for kate editor.

Someone reminds me that we don't have to track known traits for Rust's highlighting.
So I made this project, to replace the existing [kate-config](https://github.com/rust-lang/kate-config/).

## Goals
- Avoid a list for known types
- Recognize type names
- Recognize variable names

## Notice
I am not in a hurry to support the whole Rust syntax.
Instead, I wanna make sure the projects I am contributing to all renders correctly, except for Rust itself.
Here's the list:

- https://github.com/cristicbz/rust-doom
- https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/sdl2_window
